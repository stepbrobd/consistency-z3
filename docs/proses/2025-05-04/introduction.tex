\section{Introduction}

Modern distributed systems often relax strict consistency guarantees to achieve
scalability, fault tolerance, and low latency operations. Understanding and
comparing different forms of relaxed consistency semantics is crucial for both
system designers and researchers. Yet, systematically modeling and reasoning
about these semantics, as well as their compositional properties, remained a
understudied area.

Our framework aims to bridge this gap by providing a SMT-based approach to
encode and analyze the safety properties of weaker consistency models (comparing
with linearizability~\cite{herlihy1990linearizability}), and their
compositions under
the assumption of livenss properties are always satisfied, i.e. eventual
consistency~\cite{petersen1997flexible} is guaranteed (replicas
eventually converge),
and we are layering everything on top of it. By offering a per-system
(differentiated by symbols), logical representation of operations, our system
can differentiates operations belonging to distinct systems and/or components
through the use of unique symbols (see tests/test\_cross\_causal.py), enabling
analysis of cross-system interactions. Additionally, solver backends can
discharge proof witnesses on the satisfiability of specific consistency
properties, or the compatibility and composability between multiple models.
These approaches enable fast exploration and iteration of alternative system
designs, guiding the development adhere to intended consistency guarantees from
the very beginning.
